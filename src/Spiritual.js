                Any many ways it is the Lord who competes in a heavily saturated market. There are many voices clamoring for my attention. There are many temptations to spend my time and energy on things that do not have lasting value.
                My goal is to be integrated with Him, maintaining a close relationship. He invests everything in me and I must act on that investment.

                    Our entire lives should be filled with the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not just a part of our life; our life rather, is a part of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

                There is always a temptation to substitute the worldly pleasures and destractions for eternal hapiness. The substitute is cheaper and sometimes seems so much easier to obtain. 
                As I focus on the eternal rewards that differentiate the gospel from the world I am willing to pay any price to have the peace and hope that comes from living the gospel.
