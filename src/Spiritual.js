                The "Market"
            </h2>
            <div>
                In many ways it is the Lord who competes in a heavily saturated market. 
                There are many voices clamoring for my attention. 
                There are many temptations to spend my time and energy on things that do not have lasting value. 
                My goal is to be integrated with Him, maintaining a close relationship. 
                He invests everything in me and I must act on that investment.

                    Our entire lives should be filled with the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
                    The gospel of Jesus Christ is not just a part of our life; our life rather, 
                    is a part of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

                There is always a temptation to substitute the worldly pleasures and destractions for eternal happiness. 
                The substitute is cheaper and sometimes seems so much easier to obtain. 
                As I focus on the eternal rewards that differentiate the gospel from the world I am willing to pay any price to have the peace and hope that comes from living the gospel.

                        A knowledge that I am active in the church because I know it is true, and not because I lean on the testimpny of another. In many ways the inactivity of many of my family memebers strengthens my own testimony.

                And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory
            </quote>
            <div>
                I am unique and valuable by virtue of being a son of God. 
                I do not need to prove my worth to Him. While I have been granted talents that I can choose to develop. 
                My worth is not tied to my talents not my accomplishments. He wants to communicate with and guide me!

                I found the book Essentialism very enlightening. I will strive to put my most valuable resource, my time, first where it will get me the most return. 
                If I look at every area of my life as a different market. I need to ask myself, what value am I bringing to my life if I am going to spend my time on this pursuit. 
                That is not to say I will escew recreation, but my time should fist be spent on those things of the greatest value. 
                Namely, my relationships with God, my family, and others.
