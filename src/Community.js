                One of my Clifton Strengths is inclusivity. I have a desire for everyone to be invited, and for everyone to join in.

                What capabilities do I have that can be used to lift others and make the world a better place?

                    I have a talent for teaching. Using that skill I have taught on the side. 
                    While I was paid, the biggest value I saw from teaching the online program was the way I hope the program lifted those in poorer countries. 
                    The success of the United States economically can be a blessing to other countries as we seek new market for talent and labor. 
                    As we make innovative platforms that help others make money with little fixed costs.

                    I have a desire to invite others. Game nights, personal or at work. I will invite those who are new or do not know the group. 
                    This will build social experiences which have proven to help improve peoples psychology. 
                    I welcome people of various backgrounds and personalities. Getting to know them opens my perspective of the world and thiers.

                    I can share my temporal blessings with others through organization I know will put those resources to good use. 
                    This is usually done through tithing and a generous fast offering. 
                    A portion of funds is also used to bless family members who are struggling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, I can serve within the constraints of the commitments I have to my family and through them my employer.

                Unique Value Proposition
            </h2>
            <div>
                I firmly believe that the economic pie only gets bigger as others are allowed to participate in it. 
                As skills that are in demand are taught and more people move in to these industries it opens opportunities for other industries. 
                This is done by either reducing competition in less skilled labor, or by increasing demand as the financial situation of others improve. 
                Every opportunity I have to increase the education and growth of someone I see as a value add to the world and to God's children.
