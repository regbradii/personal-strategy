                Why I compete is in my mission statement? 
                I value my family second only to my relationship with my Heavenly Father and His Son.

                Where do I compete?

            <div>
                When I was 16 we moved to Mississippi. A little town called Water Valley. 
                At the time I would say it is one of the worst decisions my parents ever made. 
                It was a small backwoods town. I had grown up in California, with a short time in Utah. 
                This was a different world by comparison. However, in that town I learned about software development. 
                I had a boss who made his own hours, opposed to my father who seemed to always be on call. 
                I took programming courses in college, before and after my mission and found I both enjoyed it and was decent at it. 
                I realized that a position in software engineering would provide income sufficinet for my future wife to be a stay at home mom. 
                This was something I never had. Growing up both my parents and all the children had to work and we barely got by.

                The story above has a duel purpose. I compete in two places. I compete in a very attractive career market. 
                I also compete in a complex psycological market that I am only now discovering.

                A quick 5 Forces Analysis

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Rivals: There are lots of people in my field, across many countries, with varying skill levels. 
                    The market is still larger than the supply that can be produced.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supplier Power: The supplier and the product are the same thing; qualified Software Engineers. 
                    The demand has meant an ever increasing salary as well as opportunities to work across many industries and technologies. 
                    It is a sellers market and has been for the last 15 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Buyer Power: While companies still wield a lot of power. 
                    It can be seen in the salaries, benefits, and competing cultures that they have to put in the effort to attract the talent they want. 
                    While companies do seek cheaper off shore or near shore, the challenges are numerous; 
                   c ulture challenges around innovative thinking and questioning, time zones, and communications isssues, the list goes on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    New Entrants: Code Camps, internal training, and free classes. 
                    These all exist, but a class does not make you a competative candidate. 
                    Also, the market does not look like its going to be staurated any time soon. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Substitutes: There are companies working on Substitutes, CMS programs for marketing, no-code or low-code. 
                    These would currently be low-end entrant. 
                    The day may come that these can provide many serivces, but I think there will always be a need for the logic and design thinking that comes with software development.

            <div>
                I use my experience as a software engineer and communications skills to act as a translator between the business world and the engineering world.

            </h2>
            <div>
                I have two competing desires in my heart. The first is to provide the financial, emotional, and spiritual security that I do not feel I had as a child. 
                The second is to build something from scratch. There is a fixed desire in both to have enough money to not be worried about having to pay for all the things my family needs plus being able to provide experiences I never had as a child. 
                <b>The market</b> in this case is my time and attention. I need a job with safety and security and a steady salary to create the safety that I want to provide and that my family expects. 
                If I dedicate my limited free time to accomplish the task of building a business from scratch, then while I may provide financially, I will not be able to provide emotionally or spiritually.

                While this need to accompish, to be able to trust in the arm of my own flesh can provide temporary security and success it does not matter in the long run.

            <ul> 
                <li>
                    Rivals: I feel I am choosing to enter a much more competative market, but one I hope is also more profitable for those who can differentiate themselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Buyers: There are far more business graudates per job vs computer science graduates per job. 
                    Combine this with the fact that many managers and people leaders within technology do not ever get a business degree to get ahead. 
                    This means the buyers have a lot more power in this industry. While I feel this is true, it does not mean that the product has been reduced in value. 
                    If anything it just mean that companies are more focused on differentiation than cost.

                I also found the 8 S's interesting in regards to entering a new market.

            <div>
                What resources did I choose to expend in order to enter this new market?
            </div>
            <div>
                First, I tried greenfield development, I tried to make myself a leader. I read books on leadership and team building. 
                I worked in different capacities other than just doing software engineering. 
                I even joined a friend in a startup where I was functionaly equivilant to a CTO or Director. 
                When that failed I realized there were certain capabilities and resources I was missing that would help me be successful. 
                So, I chose an aquisition strategy by getting an MBA. I did not choose to expend vast resources I did not have however. 
                I researched my buy options, choosing an option with what I felt was the best ROI. 
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Slack: I had the time, though admitally not an abundance of it. 
                    Having spent 5 years teaching on the side, my wife and I were already accustomed to me spending time in the evenings on school things. 
                    So I had time management resources I could also deploy to be successful in this endeaver.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shared Knowledge: I hoped that am MBA would combine with my previous education experience and my work experience to help me create a better value proposition for myself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spreading Capital: I have a talent for school, for retaining knowledge, and for making mental connections. 
                    While I did not know it at the time, God provided some extra monetary capital as well in the form of a company I used to work for going public, this opening up the opportunity to use descretianary funds to pay for classes. 
                    On top of the the current student loan climate has made the loans I have taken out while the market has been down free. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Synergy: Having taught at BYU-Idaho, I chose BYU because I wanted to have a similar atmosphere to the one I was working to create when I was teaching. 
                    I was glad to be able to feel the spirit and share in the application of spiritual concepts to secular knowledge. 
                    What I did not realize at the time was how the programs would create synergies in my personal life. 
                    The Leading and Thriving course is a prime example, however, many of the classes including this one have forced me to more introspection. 
                    I have had to slow down and take a hard look at my personal and family goals. 
                    This focus has created a synergy between my business skills and life skills that are possibly more valuable than the business skills I have aquired.
